        <p>One of the biggest benefits of learning Mandarin is that it allows you to uncover the fascinating country of China on your own. Of course, you could visit China on a package tour, shunted around from site to site, but these tours often result in never getting to interact with any of the locals. Whereas if you learn some Chinese you can be more intrepid and <strong>independent</strong>, venture off the beaten track and away from the tourist traps. Take the road less travelled and you will discover the “<strong>real China</strong> ” that tourists rarely get to experience. Even knowing just a small amount of Chinese will be appreciated by the locals. They'll recognise the effort you've made to learn their language and will go to greater lengths to make you welcome in their country. </p>

        <h2>Discover Chinese culture</h2>

        <P>China's civilization is over <strong>3,000 years</strong> old, making it one of the world's oldest living civilizations. China's vast history and culture is incredibly rich, and its global impact has been considerable, from religion and philosophy to silk and pottery, from the foods we eat to kung fu and ping pong. Learning Chinese will allow you to delve deeper into China's cultural riches. For example, you could explore renowned Chinese literature like the classic novels Journey to the West and Dream of the Red Mansion, or modern contemporary works by Nobel Prize winners <strong><a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gao_Xingjian" target="_blank">Gao Xingjian</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Yan" target="_blank"> Mo Yan</a></strong>.</P>

        <p>China has produced some excellent films: the historical dramas of <strong><a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Yimou" target="_blank">Zhang Yimou</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Kaige" target="_blank"> Chen Kaige</a></strong>, the comedies of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_Xiaogang" target="_blank">Feng Xiaogang</a></strong>, and the action dramas of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_Wen" target="_blank">Jiang Wen</a></strong> are just some of the Chinese directors making entertaining, world-acclaimed movies. On the small screen, Netflix has a good selection of Chinese TV series to binge watch in their original language, and if you like music then there's plenty of great Mandopop artists to discover. </p>

        <h2>Mandarin is easy to pick up </h2>

        <p>Chinese is considered a difficult language to master because of its unique <strong>writing system </strong> and the use of tones which can be tricky for those of us used to a non-tonal language. Having said that, Chinese grammar is very straightforward. There are no complex verb conjugations or declensions of cases to memorise. So it is easier to get started with Chinese than you might think. You can start speaking conversational Chinese relatively quickly without the burden of trying to remember verb endings for past, present, and future for example. Nor do you have to worry if a noun is masculine, feminine or neuter, singular or plural, or whether the ending changes if it's the subject or the object. Grammar-wise, Chinese is refreshingly simple. </p>
